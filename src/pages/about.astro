      <h1>About</h1>

      <p>
        Hi—I’m <strong><span class="whitespace-nowrap">{author}</span></strong>, an <em>{cleanJobTitle}</em> with a passion for <em>sustainable computing, developer tooling, and complex hardware-software ecosystems</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        From my early days programming on a computer without internet, I’ve been fascinated by how software and hardware come together to solve real-world problems. That curiosity led me through a degree in computer science and into the world of <em>embedded systems, compilers, and edge AI</em>—where I continue to push the boundaries of what’s possible in resource-constrained environments.
      </p>

      <p>
        I specialize in <em>building firmware, toolchains, and runtime systems</em> that enable high-performance, low-power platforms. Over the years, I’ve worked across the entire stack—from <em>code generation and system simulation to firmware development and hardware-software co-design</em>—always with an eye toward <em>evaluating new technologies and architecting solutions from the ground up</em>.
      </p>

      <h2>How I Work</h2>

      <p>
        I thrive in the <em>design and innovation phases</em>, where ideas flow freely and the solution space is wide open. But I also enjoy implementation and debugging—the process of making abstract designs real and refining them through investigation and insight.
      </p>

      <p>
        At my core, I believe good engineering is about more than elegant code. It’s about <em>delivering value and empowering others to do their best work</em>. When we help others build better systems, we make our work matter.
      </p>

      <h2>Principles & Philosophy</h2>

      <p>
        I aim for <em>clarity, purpose, and structural integrity</em> in everything I build—from tooling and APIs to team alignment.
      </p>

      <p>
        While elegant solutions are ideal, I work pragmatically, making trade-offs based on real-world constraints while staying true to broader goals. I emphasize <em>shared understanding, clear communication, and interfaces that empower purposeful action</em>.
      </p>

      <h2>Beyond Code</h2>

      <p>
        Outside of engineering, I enjoy explaining complex topics in simple ways. I’m interested in teaching, psychology, and the dynamics of communication—all of which influence how I collaborate and lead.
      </p>
