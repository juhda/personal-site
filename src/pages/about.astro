      <h1>About</h1>

      <p>
        Hi — I’m <strong><span class="whitespace-nowrap">{author}</span></strong>, a {cleanJobTitle} with a passion for developer tooling, embedded systems, and complex hardware-software ecosystems.
      </p>

      <p>
        From my early days programming on a computer without internet, I’ve been fascinated by the power of software and the compilers that make it possible. That fascination led me through a degree in computer science and a specialization in programming languages and compilers — and it continues to drive me in my work today.
      </p>

      <p>
        I specialize in building compilers, toolchains, runtime systems, and embedded software that make high-performance platforms possible. Over the years, I’ve worked across the entire stack — from code generation to system simulation to firmware development — and led hardware-software co-design efforts to bring everything together.
      </p>

      <h2>How I Work</h2>

      <p>
        I thrive in the design phase, where ideas flow freely and the solution space is wide open. But I also enjoy implementation and debugging — the process of making abstract designs real and refining them through investigation and insight.
      </p>

      <p>
        At my core, I believe good engineering is about more than elegant code. It's about <strong>delivering value</strong>. When we help others do better work, we make our work matter.
      </p>

      <h2>Principles & Philosophy</h2>

      <p>
        I aim for clarity, purpose, and structural integrity in everything I build — from tooling to APIs to team alignment.
      </p>

      <p>
        While elegant solutions are always ideal, I’ve learned to work pragmatically, making trade-offs based on real-world constraints while staying true to the broader goals. I emphasize <strong>shared understanding</strong>, clear communication, and interfaces that empower purposeful action.
      </p>

      <h2>Beyond Code</h2>

      <p>
        Outside of engineering, I enjoy explaining complex topics in simple ways. I’m interested in <strong>teaching</strong>, <strong>psychology</strong>, and the dynamics of communication — all of which influence how I collaborate and lead.
      </p>
