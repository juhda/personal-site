        Empowering Low-Power, Sustainable Edge Learning Solutions with Structured Insight, Clarity, and Purpose.

      <p>
        I build <em>firmware, developer tools, and runtime systems</em> at the intersection of software and hardware, with a focus on <em>edge AI, embedded platforms, and hardware-software co-design</em>. My work spans <em>code generation, RISC-V-based platforms, and resource-constrained systems</em>, turning constraints into opportunities for efficiency and impact.
      </p>
      <p>
        This site is still early in its journey—I’ve recently made it a priority to share more of my work and ideas in public. Over time, you’ll find <em>technical deep-dives, project highlights, and insights on edge AI, embedded systems, and systems engineering</em>.
      </p>
