        I build compilers, toolchains, and low-level runtime systems at the intersection of software and hardware. My work includes code generation (LLVM and beyond), embedded firmware for RISC-V-based systems, system simulation, and performance-focused developer tooling.

      <p class="text-text mb-4">
        This site is still early in its journey â€” Iâ€™ve recently made it a priority to share more of my work and ideas in public. Over time, youâ€™ll find technical deep-dives, project highlights, and insights on systems engineering, developer tools, and software architecture.
