        Empowering Developer Tools, Embedded Platforms, and Complex Systems with Structured Insight, Clarity, and Purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        I build compilers, toolchains, and low-level runtime systems at the intersection of software and hardware. My work includes code generation (LLVM and beyond), firmware development for resource-constrained systems, system simulation, and performance-focused developer tooling, with ongoing experience in RISC-V-based platforms.
      </p>
      <p>
        This site is still early in its journey â€” Iâ€™ve recently made it a priority to share more of my work and ideas in public. Over time, youâ€™ll find technical deep-dives, project highlights, and insights on systems engineering, developer tools, and software architecture.
      </p>
